This repository contains my machine learning practice notebooks created during the **Samsung Innovation Campus** (SIC) program.
The notebooks cover basic machine learning concepts and implementations using Python and popular ML libraries.
I will continue adding more Notebooks, Algorithms and Projects (such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.) as I progress in my learning.

**Tools Used** ->
  Python,
  NumPy,
  Pandas,
  Matplotlib,
  Scikit-learn,
  Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab.
